## A massive week for They Vote For You

Australia got a new Prime Minister this week.
As the media detailed the step by step drama,
tens of thousands of people visited They Vote For You
to see how the players had actually voted in Parliament.

Over 30,000 people have visited They Vote For You
since the leadership challenge was announced.
This over three times as many people
as on the project’s launch day
when it featured prominently in the Guardian Australia.
In a week of so many words,
it was fantastic to see people looking for some real information
about what MPs do in Parliament.

## [Web scraping workshop success—we’re doing it again in October](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/09/24/web-scraping-workshop-success-were-doing-it-again/)

We ran our first Introduction to Web Scraping Workshop a few weeks ago
and it was a big success.

[You can read more about how it went](http://www.hellomister.com.au/new-blog/2015/9/8/web-scraping-with-openaustraliaorg)
on information graphics designer [Kelly Tall](https://twitter.com/hellomista)’s blog.
We also [blogged about the things we learned](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/09/24/web-scraping-workshop-success-were-doing-it-again/)
in this first experiment.
We’re looking forward to seeing what everyone does with their new scraping skills!

We were really pleased and impressed with how much everyone learned—so
we’re doing it all again.
We’re still locking down our date and venue,
but it will almost certainly be on Saturday, 24th October, near Central in Sydney.
There will be 10 places available.

If you want to learn how to scrape structured data for your projects
then let us know you’re interested via [email](mailto:contact@oaf.org.au) or

and we'll let you know when registrations open shortly.

## [FoxScan](http://www.feralscan.org.au/foxscan/default.aspx)

Since foxes were introduced into Australia in 1871
they have caused huge damage to native species.
Foxes are a designated pest throughout the country.

People around Australia are now
reporting fox sightings through FoxScan.
The project maps the reported fox activity
to help inform and connect a coalition of
pest control, researchers, community groups and land owners
so they can reduce the damage caused by foxes.

## [EveryPolitician – 200 countries and counting](https://www.mysociety.org/2015/09/15/everypolitician-200-countries-and-counting/)

For Global Legislative Openness Week 2015 [EveryPolitician](http://everypolitician.org/)
set the ambitious target to add 66 more nations to their project
and pass the 200 mark—and [they did it!](https://www.mysociety.org/2015/09/15/everypolitician-200-countries-and-counting/)
People from all around the world contributed research and scrapers to hit the goal.

EveryPolitician is an open, free repository
of information on politicians from (now) over 200 national parliaments
that you can use in your projects.

## [FOI and eyes wide shut: even public servants want to know](http://www.themandarin.com.au/49024-foi-security-clearance-creep-eyes-wide-shut/)

[Suelette Dreyfus](https://twitter.com/sueletted) made a clear case for
a more open, reliable Freedom of Information system in Australia
to a conference hall full of public servants in August.
[Read a transcript of the address in The
Mandarin](http://www.themandarin.com.au/49024-foi-security-clearance-creep-eyes-wide-shut/).

Dreyfus argues that a more open government
isn’t only in the public interest,
but can also protect the independence of public servants
and foster public trust in government.

## [Freedominfo.org is creating a deliberative process exemption library](http://www.freedominfo.org/resources/deliberative-process-exemption-library/)

In Freedom of Information law
_deliberative process exemptions_ are rules designed
to protect the open and frank flow of advice and discussion inside government
by restricting it from public access.

Freedominfo.org is [creating a library](http://www.freedominfo.org/resources/deliberative-process-exemption-library/)
of model examples of these rules
and summaries of national laws that you can compare.
How do your government’s rules compare to others?
What would you change?

If you’re government isn’t listed yet you can contribute it to the list.

Economist Joseph Stiglitz discusses
the justification for these kinds of public access exemptions
and their impact in his
[1999 lecture on the importance of transparency to good governance (PDF)](http://internationalbudget.org/wp-content/uploads/On-Liberty-the-Right-to-Know-and-Public-Discourse-The-Role-of-Transparency-in-Public-Life.pdf).
