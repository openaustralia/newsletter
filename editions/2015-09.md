## [Freedominfo.org is creating a deliberative process exemption library](http://www.freedominfo.org/resources/deliberative-process-exemption-library/)

In Freedom of Information law
_deliberative process exemptions_ are rules designed
to protect the open and frank flow of advice and discussion inside government
by restricting it from public access.

Freedominfo.org is [creating a library](http://www.freedominfo.org/resources/deliberative-process-exemption-library/)
of model examples of these rules
and summaries of national laws that you can compare.
How do your government’s rules compare to others?
What would you change?

If you’re government isn’t listed yet you can contribute it to the list.

Economist Joseph Stiglitz discusses
the justification for these kinds of public access exemptions
and their impact in his
[1999 lecture on the importance of transparency to good governance (PDF)](http://internationalbudget.org/wp-content/uploads/On-Liberty-the-Right-to-Know-and-Public-Discourse-The-Role-of-Transparency-in-Public-Life.pdf).
