## News and Notes

### [A massive week for They Vote For You](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/09/24/a-massive-week-for-they-vote-for-you/)

Australia got a new Prime Minister last week.
As the media detailed the step by step drama,
[tens of thousands of people visited They Vote For You](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/09/24/a-massive-week-for-they-vote-for-you/)
to see how the players had actually voted in Parliament.

Over 30,000 people have visited [They Vote For You](https://theyvoteforyou.org.au)
since the leadership challenge was announced.
This is over three times as many people
as on the project’s launch day
when it featured prominently in the Guardian Australia.
In a week of so many words,
it was fantastic to see people looking for some real information
about what MPs do in Parliament.

### [Web scraping workshop success—we’re doing it again in October](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/09/24/web-scraping-workshop-success-were-doing-it-again/)

We ran our first Introduction to Web Scraping Workshop a few weeks ago
and it was a big success.

[You can read more about how it went](http://www.hellomister.com.au/new-blog/2015/9/8/web-scraping-with-openaustraliaorg)
on information graphics designer [Kelly Tall](https://twitter.com/hellomista)’s blog.
We also [blogged about the things we learned](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/09/24/web-scraping-workshop-success-were-doing-it-again/)
in this first experiment.
We’re looking forward to seeing what everyone does with their new scraping skills!

We were really pleased and impressed with how much everyone learned—so
we’re doing it all again.
We’re still locking down our date and venue,
but it will almost certainly be on Saturday, 24th October, near Central in Sydney.
There will be 10 places available.

If you want to learn how to scrape structured data for your projects
then let us know you’re interested via [email](mailto:contact@oaf.org.au) or
[twitter](https://twitter.com/OpenAustralia).
Then we can contact you when registrations open shortly.

### [EveryPolitician – 200 countries and counting](https://www.mysociety.org/2015/09/15/everypolitician-200-countries-and-counting/)

For Global Legislative Openness Week 2015 [EveryPolitician](http://everypolitician.org/)
set the ambitious target to add 66 more nations to their project
and pass the 200 mark—and [they did it!](https://www.mysociety.org/2015/09/15/everypolitician-200-countries-and-counting/)
People from all around the world contributed research and scrapers to hit the goal.

EveryPolitician is an open, free repository
of information on politicians from (now) over 200 national parliaments
that you can use in your projects.

### [FOI and eyes wide shut: even public servants want to know](http://www.themandarin.com.au/49024-foi-security-clearance-creep-eyes-wide-shut/)

[Suelette Dreyfus](https://twitter.com/sueletted) made a clear case for
a more open, reliable Freedom of Information system in Australia
to a conference hall full of public servants in August.
[Read a transcript of the address in The
Mandarin](http://www.themandarin.com.au/49024-foi-security-clearance-creep-eyes-wide-shut/).

Dreyfus argues that a more open government
isn’t only in the public interest,
but can also protect the independence of public servants
and foster public trust in government.

### [Freedominfo.org is creating a deliberative process exemption library](http://www.freedominfo.org/resources/deliberative-process-exemption-library/)

In Freedom of Information law
_deliberative process exemptions_ are rules designed
to protect the open and frank flow of advice and discussion inside government
by restricting it from public access.

Freedominfo.org is [creating a library](http://www.freedominfo.org/resources/deliberative-process-exemption-library/)
of model examples of these rules
and summaries of national laws that you can compare.
How do your government’s rules compare to others?
What would you change?

If you’re government isn’t listed yet you can contribute it to the resource.

Economist Joseph Stiglitz discusses
the justification for these kinds of public access exemptions
and their impact in his
[1999 lecture on the importance of transparency to good governance (PDF)](http://internationalbudget.org/wp-content/uploads/On-Liberty-the-Right-to-Know-and-Public-Discourse-The-Role-of-Transparency-in-Public-Life.pdf).

### [Leadership transition at Open North](http://www.opennorth.ca/2015/09/22/announcing-a-leadership-transition-at-open-north.html)

[Canadian civic tech organisation Open North
have a new executive director](http://www.opennorth.ca/2015/09/22/announcing-a-leadership-transition-at-open-north.html)
[Jean-Noé Landry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeannoelandry)
as founder [James McKinney](https://twitter.com/mckinneyjames)
moves on to new things.

We’re looking forward to seeing how OpenNorth
continue to grow with a new director
and can’t wait to see what James does next.

[In this post](http://www.opennorth.ca/2015/09/22/announcing-a-leadership-transition-at-open-north.html)
James shares his current thoughts about
where he fit as an individual inside the organisation he founded
and looks back on his approach as executive director.

### [FoxScan](http://www.feralscan.org.au/foxscan/default.aspx)

Since foxes were introduced into Australia in 1871
they have caused huge damage to native species.
Foxes are a designated pest throughout the country.

[FoxScan](http://www.feralscan.org.au/foxscan/default.aspx)
gives information to people trying to fix this problem.
You input sightings of foxes and the damage they cause
and Foxscan—rather than just sucking it into a black hole—tries
to make it available to everyone.
It shares some similarities with [GrowStuff](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/02/19/civic-tech-monthly-feb-2015/#user-content-growstuff)
in that it helps people share disparate information
and tries to empower a community of practitioners
working independently but contributing to a social good.

### morph.io got a big new server and continues to grow

A couple of months ago we celebrated the 3000th scraper running on morph.io.
In the last week we passed 3600 scrapers
and there’s now 3000 people using the platform—yikes!

With all this new use morph.io’s server was beginning to struggle.
Some scrapers were also requiring more memory than we could allocate them.

After a [helpful discussion](https://github.com/openaustralia/morph/issues/898)
we upgraded to a bigger, more powerful server.
You can now scraper bigger documents and run more memory intensive processes,
as we increased the memory allowance for
your scraper runs from 100 MB to 512 MB.

[If morph.io is useful to you,
please become a supporter to keep it running and open to all.](ihttps://morph.io/supporters/new)
