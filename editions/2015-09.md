## [EveryPolitician – 200 countries and counting](https://www.mysociety.org/2015/09/15/everypolitician-200-countries-and-counting/)

For Global Legislative Openness Week 2015 [EveryPolitician](http://everypolitician.org/)
set the ambitious target to add 66 more nations to their project
and pass the 200 mark—and [they did it!](https://www.mysociety.org/2015/09/15/everypolitician-200-countries-and-counting/)
People from all around the world contributed research and scrapers to hit the goal.

EveryPolitiican is an open, free repository
of information on politicians from (now) over 200 national parliaments
that you can use in your projects.

## [FOI and eyes wide shut: even public servants want to know](http://www.themandarin.com.au/49024-foi-security-clearance-creep-eyes-wide-shut/)

Suelette Dreyfus made a clear case for
a more open, reliable Freedom of Information system in Australia
to a conference hall full of public servants in August.
[Read a transcript of the address in The
Mandarin](http://www.themandarin.com.au/49024-foi-security-clearance-creep-eyes-wide-shut/).

Dreyfus argues that a more open government
isn’t only in the public interest,
but can also protect the independence of public servants
and foster public trust in government.

## [Freedominfo.org is creating a deliberative process exemption library](http://www.freedominfo.org/resources/deliberative-process-exemption-library/)

In Freedom of Information law
_deliberative process exemptions_ are rules designed
to protect the open and frank flow of advice and discussion inside government
by restricting it from public access.

Freedominfo.org is [creating a library](http://www.freedominfo.org/resources/deliberative-process-exemption-library/)
of model examples of these rules
and summaries of national laws that you can compare.
How do your government’s rules compare to others?
What would you change?

If you’re government isn’t listed yet you can contribute it to the list.

Economist Joseph Stiglitz discusses
the justification for these kinds of public access exemptions
and their impact in his
[1999 lecture on the importance of transparency to good governance (PDF)](http://internationalbudget.org/wp-content/uploads/On-Liberty-the-Right-to-Know-and-Public-Discourse-The-Role-of-Transparency-in-Public-Life.pdf).
