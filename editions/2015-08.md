### [Introduction to Web Scraping Workshop in Sydney](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/08/07/introduction-to-web-scraping-workshop-in-sydney/)

Join us in Sydney in two weeks time to learn how to write a web scraper.
You can use a scraper to quickly grab all kinds of information for analysis and processing.
Scrapers are the backbone of OpenAustralia Foundation projects such as They Vote For You and
PlanningAlerts—we’re always finding new ways that scrapers can help, and we're keen to share this skill.
[You can find out more and register via our blog post](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/08/07/introduction-to-web-scraping-workshop-in-sydney/).

This is a hands-on, half-day workshop and by the afternoon you will have written a web scraper.
Tickets are $295 and the workshop is in Redfern, Sydney on Friday the 4th of September.
You will need a laptop and some programming experience to attend but you don't have to be an expert.
If you know what a variable, loop and array are, then this is for you.

This is a new experiment for the OpenAustralia Foundation.
We're trying out a new approach to help people who want to make their own projects.
If you can't make the workshop, but know someone who might be interested,
we’d really appreciate if you could pass this along.

### [Soft launch of Freedom of Information Portal for Malaysia](https://right2knowmy.wordpress.com/2015/07/30/soft-launch-of-freedom-of-information-portal-for-malaysia/)

You can now use [Malaysia’s first Freedom of Information portal](https://right2knowmy.wordpress.com/2015/07/30/soft-launch-of-freedom-of-information-portal-for-malaysia/)
to ask their governments for information. Of course it’s built on [Alaveteli](http://alaveteli.org/)!

> By law, we have Freedom of Information Enactments (FOIE) in the following two states: Selangor & Penang.
> However, we have also added the avenue to request for information from Public Authorities not covered by FOI
> in order to gauge what citizens want to know at the Federal level.

This is a nice example of [one of the Civic Patterns](http://civicpatterns.org/patterns/make-your-own-reality/) we like to follow at OAF:
“When designing a service, make your process reflect the legal rules that you wish existed, instead of those that do. Reality will catch up.”

### [Yo Quiero Saber 2015](http://www.yoquierosaber.org/)

This month Argentines got to compare the basic positions of candidates using a simple game.
First you have to state your position on an issue, then the you see the positions of the candidates.
This dynamic leads you through to see where you stand compared to to all the candidates.

The feedback so far is that people felt informed and used it to pick candidates that better represented their views.
[Martín Szyszlican, one of the creators, says](https://twitter.com/equivalentideas/status/634218147977924609) they’ll keep running and developing the project,
and that the big challenge is to reach more people.
This time they had over 1% of voters, doubling their audience in 2013, but not enough to impact election results.

### [Help work out the gender balance of 100 parliaments](http://www.gender-balance.org/)

> Which country has the highest proportion of women in parliament?
> Do women vote differently on issues like defence, the environment, or maternity benefits?
> Exactly when did women come into power in different countries, and did their presence change the way the country was run?
> Frustratingly, these are questions for which it’s difficult to provide an answer, because the objective data just isn’t there ...
> So we created Gender Balance, an easy game that crowd-sources gender data across every parliament in the world.

Believe it or not, but you can have fun, learn about your parliament, and generate useful open data all at the same time.

### [CKAN meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Australia-Open-Data/events/224662756/) and [Hacks/Hackers in Sydney](http://www.meetup.com/Hacks-Hackers-Sydney/events/224577552/)

In more Sydney event news, after the scraping workshop we can walk down to
[the CKAN meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Australia-Open-Data/events/224662756/).
There’ll be lots of people with experience working with and publishing open data.

Hacks/Hackers is also back on in Sydney. The next meetup,
[Data Journalism and Investigations in Political Reporting](http://www.meetup.com/Hacks-Hackers-Sydney/events/224577552/),
is on Wednesday evening, September 16. You should give a lightning talk if you’re in town.
