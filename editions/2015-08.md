### [Introduction to Web Scraping Workshop in Sydney](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/08/07/introduction-to-web-scraping-workshop-in-sydney/)

Join us in Sydney in two weeks time to learn how to write a web scraper.
You can use a scraper to quickly grab all kinds of information for analysis and processing.
Scrapers are the backbone of OpenAustralia Foundation projects such as They Vote For You and
PlanningAlerts—we’re always finding new ways that scrapers can help, and we're keen to share this skill.
[You can find out more and register via our blog post](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/08/07/introduction-to-web-scraping-workshop-in-sydney/).

This is a hands-on, half-day workshop and by the afternoon you will have written a web scraper.
Tickets are $295 and the workshop is in Redfern, Sydney on Friday the 4th of September.
You will need a laptop and some programming experience to attend but you don't have to be an expert.
If you know what a variable, loop and array are, then this is for you.

This is a new experiment for the OpenAustralia Foundation.
We're trying out a new approach to help people who want to make their own projects.
If you can't make the workshop, but know someone who might be interested,
we’d really appreciate if you could pass this along.

### CKAN meetup and Hacks/Hackers in Sydney

In more Sydney event news, after the scraping workshop we can walk down to
