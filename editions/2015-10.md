### [Matthew Landauer joins the Digital Transformation Office](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/10/05/matthew-and-the-digital-transformation-office/)

At the beginning of October co-founder of the OpenAustralia Foundation
[Matthew Landauer joined the Digital Transformation Office (DTO)](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/10/05/matthew-and-the-digital-transformation-office/).
The DTO is an new Australian Government agency set up to
transform government and make government services
simpler, clearer, faster and more humane.

We’re extremely proud and excited to see how Matthew will deliver
practical improvements to government services for Australians everywhere
and demonstrate new ways for government to work through the DTO.

Since creating openaustralia.org.au over 7 years ago
Matthew has worked tirelessly to better connect people
with their communities, governments and politicians
through the OpenAustralia Foundation.
While many people talk about this, Matthew just gets on and makes it happen.
He’s done this by programming, designing and writing websites that
have been used by millions of people,
and by teaching and inspiring others to do the same as a leader in civic tech.

In order for the OpenAustralia Foundation to maintain
its independence Matthew is stepping down as a director of the foundation.

[Read Matthew’s post about joining the DTO on the OpenAustralia Foundation blog](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/10/05/matthew-and-the-digital-transformation-office/).

There must be something in the water because this has been a big year for
changing leadership in civic tech organisations with
[Tom Steinberg moving on from mySociety](https://www.mysociety.org/2015/08/07/my-last-post/)
and [James McKinney from OpenNorth](http://www.opennorth.ca/2015/09/22/announcing-a-leadership-transition-at-open-north.html).
