### [Matthew Landauer joins the Digital Transformation Office](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/10/05/matthew-and-the-digital-transformation-office/)

At the beginning of October co-founder of the OpenAustralia Foundation
[Matthew Landauer joined the Digital Transformation Office (DTO)](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/10/05/matthew-and-the-digital-transformation-office/).
The DTO is an new Australian Government agency set up to
transform government and make government services
simpler, clearer, faster and more humane.

We’re extremely proud and excited to see how Matthew will deliver
practical improvements to government services for Australians everywhere
and demonstrate new ways for government to work through the DTO.

Since creating openaustralia.org.au over 7 years ago
Matthew has worked tirelessly to better connect people
with their communities, governments and politicians
through the OpenAustralia Foundation.
While many people talk about this, Matthew just gets on and makes it happen.
He’s done this by programming, designing and writing websites that
have been used by millions of people,
and by teaching and inspiring others to do the same as a leader in civic tech.

In order for the OpenAustralia Foundation to maintain
its independence Matthew is stepping down as a director of the foundation.

[Read Matthew’s post about joining the DTO on the OpenAustralia Foundation blog](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/10/05/matthew-and-the-digital-transformation-office/).

There must be something in the water because this has been a big year for
changing leadership in civic tech organisations with
[Tom Steinberg moving on from mySociety](https://www.mysociety.org/2015/08/07/my-last-post/)
and [James McKinney from OpenNorth](http://www.opennorth.ca/2015/09/22/announcing-a-leadership-transition-at-open-north.html).

### [Learn web scraping this Sunday with the OpenAustralia Foundation](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/introduction-to-web-scraping-workshop-tickets-18858393964)

There are still three spots available for the
[Introduction to Web Scraping Workshop this Sunday, in Sydney](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/introduction-to-web-scraping-workshop-tickets-18858393964).

If you’re a data journalist, app developer, researcher, or you just need to
quickly collect and track information, then knowing how to scrape data from the
web will save you time and open up new opportunities.

In this hands on, half-day workshop you’ll get experience creating a scraper
with developers from the OpenAustralia Foundation.
By the afternoon you’ll have written a scraper to collect data from websites daily.

### [Web scraping in Ruby tutorial](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/tag/ruby-web-scraping-tutorial-on-morph-io/)

Walk through creating a web scraper in Ruby and running it on morph.io
in this [blog post series](mak://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/tag/ruby-web-scraping-tutorial-on-morph-io/).
This is a detailed tutorial in which you
actually create, publish and run your own working scraper.

Give it a try and let us know how you go.
Through recourses like this, and our workshops,
we want to help more people get the skills
to build the projects they want to see.
Any feedback on the tutorial would be greatly appreciated.

### [Who comments in PlanningAlerts and how could it work better?](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/10/20/who-comments-in-planningalerts-and-how-could-it-work-better/)

About a month ago we started some design research to learn from the people who use
PlanningAlerts how we can make the experience of commenting on local planning better.
[This post talks about how we’re approaching design research and our observations in this project so far](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/10/20/who-comments-in-planningalerts-and-how-could-it-work-better/)

We’ve currently working on a new feature
to help people write to their elected local councillors about planning applications.
The aim is to strengthen the connection between citizens and local councillors around one of
the most important things that local government does: planning. We’re
also trying to improve the whole commenting flow in PlanningAlerts.
