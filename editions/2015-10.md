##  News and Notes

### Thank you Matthew

There must be something in the water because this has been a big year for
changing leadership in civic tech organisations with
[Tom Steinberg moving on from mySociety](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/08/20/civic-tech-monthly-august-2015/#thankyoutom)
and [James McKinney from OpenNorth](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/09/25/civic-tech-monthly-september-2015/#leadershiptransitionatopennorth). This time it's [our very own co-founder Matthew Landauer](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/10/05/matthew-and-the-digital-transformation-office/).

So now it's our turn to say thank you to Matthew.
Since creating OpenAustralia.org.au over 7 years ago
Matthew has worked tirelessly to better connect people
with their communities, governments and politicians
through his work at the OpenAustralia Foundation.
While many people talk about this, Matthew just gets on and makes it happen.
He’s done this by programming, designing and writing websites that
have been used by millions of people,
and by teaching and inspiring others to do the same as a leader in civic tech.

From Henare and Luke, thank you Matthew for everything you taught us. With Kat keeping our feet on the ground, we'll continue to put what you taught us to work. [We're full steam ahead](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/10/15/weve-got-a-lot-to-finish-in-2015-here-is-our-plan/).

### [Democracy Club plans for 2016 UK elections](https://democracyclub.org.uk/blog/2015/10/19/plans-for-2016/)

For the UK’s 2015 elections [Democracy Club](https://democracyclub.org.uk/) helped
thousands of people in the UK vote and find out more about candidates.
Now [they’re laying down plans for their next round](https://democracyclub.org.uk/blog/2015/10/19/plans-for-2016/):

> May 2016 will see a much wider range of elections in the UK - from local
> councils to city mayors, from police commissioners to the devolved assemblies
> and parliaments...

> For May 2016, we’ve set ourselves the ambitious target of knowing about every
> candidate in every election in the UK...
>
> And that’s not all. On 7 May, we noticed that one of the most popular internet
> searches was: “Where do I vote?” For that reason, among others, we think there’s
> real value to be gained in open data for polling stations - their locations and
> the areas they serve.

If you’ve got elections coming up in your area
check out their plans and how they approach these projects.
Maybe these ideas will inspire a project of your own,
of course [all their projects are open source for you to use](https://democracyclub.org.uk/projects/).

### [Update to an Open Data Masters Thesis](http://zarino.co.uk/post/thesis)

In 2011 [Zarino Zappia](http://zarino.co.uk/) completed his Masters thesis on the state of
“open data” use in the UK and USA:
[‘Participation, Power, Provenance: Mapping Information Flows in Open Data Development’ [4MB PDF]](http://zarino.co.uk/media/thesis.pdf).
Early this month he [posted some thoughts about what has and hasn’t changed since then](http://zarino.co.uk/post/thesis)
touching on what government, hackers, non-profits, and the private sector are up to.
It’s a wonderful and refreshingly honest appraisal of the state of open data.

### [New York Senate relaunches with a website designed for citizens](http://civichall.org/civicist/new-york-senate-site-relaunches-with-listening-features/)

It’s great to see a [legislature launch a website](http://civichall.org/civicist/new-york-senate-site-relaunches-with-listening-features/)
that has been designed to help citizens.
There’s still lots of work to do,
but it’s a big step ahead of what most people around the world get.
How does [nysenate.gov](http://www.nysenate.gov/) compare to your local senate or parliament’s website?

[Civicist have collect perspectives on the new system with particular focus on the interesting “listening” features](http://civichall.org/civicist/new-york-senate-site-relaunches-with-listening-features/).

### [Freedom of Information sketch diary](http://myfanwytristram.com/2015/09/25/madridfreedom-of-information-sketch-diary-part-one/)

[Myfanwy Tristram has posted her amazing sketches from Alaveteli Con 2015](http://myfanwytristram.com/2015/09/25/madridfreedom-of-information-sketch-diary-part-one/)
the [international conference on Freedom of Information technologies](https://www.mysociety.org/projects/freedom-of-information/alaveteli/alavetelicon-2015/).

The sketches are a great introduction
to the characters behind FOI projects around the world.
Myfanwy gives you a real sense of the different flavour
that each team brings to their common mission.

[The sketches are published over 5 posts on Myfanwy’s blog](http://myfanwytristram.com/tag/freedom-of-information/).

### [‘Governments do not like freedom of information’: the war on Australia's privacy and information watchdog](http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/oct/01/governments-do-not-like-freedom-of-information-the-war-on-australias-privacy-and-information-watchdog)

Paul Farrell reviews the current state of Freedom of Information in Australia
and The office of the Australian information commissioner (OAIC).
In this piece the former information commissioner John McMillan
talks quite frankly about government pressure on the office and its impact.
Paul explains some of the options available to block the OAICs abolition in Parliament.

### [Web scraping tutorial](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/tag/ruby-web-scraping-tutorial-on-morph-io/)

Walk through creating a web scraper in Ruby and running it on morph.io
in this [blog post series](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/tag/ruby-web-scraping-tutorial-on-morph-io/).
This is a detailed tutorial in which you
actually create, publish and run your own working scraper.

Give it a try and let us know how you go.
We’re keen to help more people get the skills
to build the projects they want to see.
Any feedback on the tutorial would be greatly appreciated.

If you’ve in Sydney this weekend and keen to learn scraping,
we’ve still got three spots open in our
[Introduction to Web Scraping Workshop on Sunday](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/introduction-to-web-scraping-workshop-tickets-18858393964).

### [Videos from Code for America Summit](https://www.youtube.com/user/CodeforAmerica/playlists)

[Code for America Summit](https://www.codeforamerica.org/summit/) was earlier this month
and [you can now watch it all online](https://www.youtube.com/user/CodeforAmerica/playlists),

### [Who comments in PlanningAlerts and how could it work better?](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/10/20/who-comments-in-planningalerts-and-how-could-it-work-better/)

About a month ago we started some design research to learn from the people who use
PlanningAlerts how we can make the experience of commenting on local planning better.
[This post talks about how we’re approaching design research and our observations in this project so far](https://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/2015/10/20/who-comments-in-planningalerts-and-how-could-it-work-better/)

We’ve currently working on a new feature
to help people write to their elected local councillors about planning applications.
The aim is to strengthen the connection between citizens and local councillors around one of
the most important things that local government does: planning. We’re
also trying to improve the whole commenting flow in PlanningAlerts.

### [The Impacts of Civic Technology Conference 2016, call for papers](https://www.mysociety.org/research/tictec-2016/)

Speaking of research,
[the Impacts of Civic Technology Conference (TICTEC) is on again in 2016](https://www.mysociety.org/research/tictec-2016/).
TICTEC was a great success in 2015. It collected people from all over the world
to talk and learn about research in civic tech and the impact that these projects make.

TICTEC 2016 will be 27th-28th April 2016 in Barcelona.
The call for papers and workshop ideas is now open.
