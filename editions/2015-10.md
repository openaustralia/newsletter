There are still three spots available for the
[Introduction to Web Scraping Workshop this Sunday, in Sydney](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/introduction-to-web-scraping-workshop-tickets-18858393964).

If you’re a data journalist, app developer, researcher, or you just need to
quickly collect and track information, then knowing how to scrape data from the
web will save you time and open up new opportunities.

In this hands on, half-day workshop you’ll get experience creating a scraper
with developers from the OpenAustralia Foundation.
By the afternoon you’ll have written a scraper to collect data from websites daily.
