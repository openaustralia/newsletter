##  News and Notes

### [We're having an end of year party in Sydney](http://www.meetup.com/OpenAustralia-Foundation/events/226363975/)

2015 has been an incredibly busy year for the OpenAustralia Foundation.
To celebrate our achievements, and all of you who have helped us on the way,
we're going to have [a little party on Sunday, the 6th of December](http://www.meetup.com/OpenAustralia-Foundation/events/226363975/).
It’ll be pretty low key and casual (what else?).
We're going to head to lovely [Bicentennial Park on the Glebe foreshore](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bicentennial+Park+-+Glebe/@-33.8725431,151.1605678,7313m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!1m3!3m2!1s0x6b12afd1b80160cf:0xf017d68f9f222f0!2sBicentennial+Park+-+Glebe!3m1!1s0x6b12afd1b80160cf:0xf017d68f9f222f0!6m1!1e1?hl=en)
and hang out from 11:00 and enjoy some sunshine, a drink, and something to eat.

We’d love for you to join us. Please come along any time after 11:00. BYO food and drinks.
We should be able to use the park barbecues if you've got something that needs cooking.
