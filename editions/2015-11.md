##  News and Notes

### [We're having an end of year party in Sydney](http://www.meetup.com/OpenAustralia-Foundation/events/226363975/)

2015 has been an incredibly busy year for the OpenAustralia Foundation.
To celebrate our achievements, and all of you who have helped us on the way,
we're going to have [a little party on Sunday, the 6th of December](http://www.meetup.com/OpenAustralia-Foundation/events/226363975/).
It’ll be pretty low key and casual (what else?).
We're going to head to lovely [Bicentennial Park on the Glebe foreshore](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bicentennial+Park+-+Glebe/@-33.8725431,151.1605678,7313m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!1m3!3m2!1s0x6b12afd1b80160cf:0xf017d68f9f222f0!2sBicentennial+Park+-+Glebe!3m1!1s0x6b12afd1b80160cf:0xf017d68f9f222f0!6m1!1e1?hl=en)
and hang out from 11:00 and enjoy some sunshine, a drink, and something to eat.

We’d love for you to join us. Please come along any time after 11:00. BYO food and drinks.
RSVP on the [Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/OpenAustralia-Foundation/events/226363975/).

### [There's a hackathon to help refugees in Sydney](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/techfugees-australia-hackathon-tickets-19351828841)

The Techfugees Australia Hackathon is happening next weekend in Sydney on the 28th and 29th of November.
It's billed as the Sydney tech community's response to the current refugee crisis involving a network of concerned individuals and inspired by recent [similar events in Europe](http://www.techfugees.com/).

It's great to see that the event has partnered with organisations that will describe the challenges they face to participants. This makes it far more likely that the solutions developed will be for real problems and will hopefully see real world use.

If you want to use your civic tech skills for good, [register soon](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/techfugees-australia-hackathon-tickets-19351828841) as there's only a few places left.

### [Australian Government finally commits to finalising OGP membership](http://ogpau.govspace.gov.au/)

It's been a long and often rocky journey but the Australian Government has finally committed to finalising its membership of the Open Government Partnership. Now the real hard work can begin, starting with the [development of a national action plan](http://ogpau.govspace.gov.au/national-action-plan/) for open government.

Congratulations to the people working behind the scenes to make this happen. And thanks to Peter Timmins for tirelessly keeping us [up to date with the latest developments](http://foi-privacy.blogspot.com.au/search/label/Australia.%20Open%20Government%20Partnership.) over at his blog, Open and Shut.
