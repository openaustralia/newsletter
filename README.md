# Civic Tech Monthly (Feb 2015 - Nov 2015)

This was an email newsletter produced by the [OpenAustralia Foundation](http://oaf.org.au) **for people who are interested in development of technology that empowers people to change their society**. It had [10 editions](https://github.com/openaustralia/newsletter/tree/master/editions) between Feburary 2015 and November 2015.

The jobs that this newsletter aimed to do for people include:

* provide examples of how technology is being used to enable civic change, that they weren't previously aware of
* connect them to other people interested in the things that they are interested in
* reassure them of the positive impact these projects can have
* give them interesting things to read
* provide them with projects that they can use themselves
* let them know about events they can go to

The newsletter was sent out the Thursday before the [OpenAustralia Foundation meetup](http://www.meetup.com/OpenAustralia-Foundation/), which is held on the last Tuesday of the month.

## Principles

These are the principles that guide the development and editorial direction of this project:

* People are smart *and* busy
* Humans respond to humans, so have fun
* Promote a diverse civic tech community because it’s better for everyone

We're aiming for 50% of things in the newsletter to be from or about the Asia-Pacific region and half of that from Australia. We want to promote and support our local civic tech community in particular—there are other excellent newsletters that have a broad global focus.
