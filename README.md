# Civic Tech Monthly [![Stories in next edition](https://badge.waffle.io/openaustralia/newsletter.svg?label=next%20edition&title=Next%20edition)](http://waffle.io/openaustralia/newsletter)

An email newsletter produced by the [OpenAustralia Foundation](http://oaf.org.au) **for people who are interested in development of technology that empowers people to change their society**. Sounds like you? [**Subscribe**](http://eepurl.com/bcE0DX).

Please [contribute your treasured links from this month by submitting an issue](https://github.com/openaustralia/newsletter/issues/new?title=[ITEM]).

The jobs that this newsletter should do for these people include:

* provide examples of how technology is being used to enable civic change, that they weren't previously aware of
* connect them to other people interested in the things that they are interested in
* reassure them of the positive impact these projects can have
* give them interesting things to read
* provide them with projects that they can use themselves
* let them know about events they can go to

The newsletter is sent out the Thursday before the [OpenAustralia Foundation meetup](http://www.meetup.com/OpenAustralia-Foundation/), which is held on the last Tuesday of the month.

The Civic Tech Monthly is available for you to share, remix, mashup and whatever else you can come up with under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

## Principles

These are the principles that guide the development and editorial direction of this project:

* People are smart *and* busy
* Humans respond to humans, so have fun
* Promote a diverse civic tech community because it’s better for everyone

We're aiming for 50% of things in the newsletter to be from or about the Asia-Pacific region and half of that from Australia. We want to promote and support our local civic tech community in particular—there are other excellent newsletters that have a broad global focus.
